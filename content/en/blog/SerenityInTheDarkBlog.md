### Serenity In The Dark

Mysterious summer night

My second painting is finally finished and I just realized it's been more than a month since my last painting *lol.

Completed on June 6, 2023

### Before Post Processing

I did some color adjustments at the end

### Balancing Composition

I imagined her to have magical lamps hanging from her Halbert(Polearm) to illuminate her way but after painting them all the focus was directing to the lamps. So gave her a mysterious earring to balance the composition. Since there aren't many "Neon Cyan" colored objects in the painting, it stood out. Joining earring and two lamps we have a triangular composition which is directing focus at the center.

Here how it look without her earring

### Did You Noticed The Hairpin?

Yeah, she has hairpin

### Water Layer

I mirrored the upper sky part and erased the grass mask layer. And again painted the grass over both the layers

### How I Painted Halbert

Last time polearm in my painting After Winter was not looking good so I made 3D model in Blender to get it right this time.
I made 3D model in the Blender, positioned it according to the painting, rendered and imported image in Krita. And painted over it.
