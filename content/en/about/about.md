### Summary

Nice to meet you I am Vedant Shahare, an indie game developer currently working on a small horror RPG and learning to make game engines. My expertise encompasses the utilization of software tools such as Unreal Engine, C++, Blender and Krita, all of which bring ideas to life.
Furthermore, I possess knowledge in project build systems, employing CMake and Premake. Additionally, I leverage Python for the development of automated setup scripts. Concurrently, I am dedicated to the construction of my own 3D game engine using C++.
In parallel, I am cultivating my skills as a concept artist, specializing in creating illustrations with Krita.
Thank you for considering my professional background. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to and collaborate on innovative projects within the realm of game development and artistic expression.
