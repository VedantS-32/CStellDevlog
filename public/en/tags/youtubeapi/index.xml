      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;project-skill-completion-pipeline-powered-by-you&#34;&gt;Project Skill Completion Pipeline &amp;lsquo;Powered by You&amp;rsquo;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Project Skill Completion Pipeline repository! Hi, this is my first year college project on the theme &amp;ldquo;Inovative Idea&amp;rdquo;. This project aims to revolutionize the way we approach online learning by providing a structured and streamlined platform for skill acquisition. The overwhelming abundance of online learning resources often leaves learners uncertain about where to begin, what to learn next, and whether a course is worth their time. The Skill Completion Pipeline addresses these challenges by offering a curated repository of learning resources and a well-defined learning path for users of all skill levels.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
